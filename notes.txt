"editor.getCursor": (): number => {
  return editor.editorView!.state.selection.main.from;
},
"editor.getSelection": (): { from: number; to: number } => {
  return editor.editorView!.state.selection.main;
},

Text.lineAt(pos)

So to get cursor line / char:

let cursor = editorView.state.selection.main.from;
let line = editorView.state.doc.lineAt(cursor);
let lineNo = line.number;
let charNo = cursor - line.from;


Things present in notepad2 but not in notepad2web:
* Exit menu and toolbar icon
* Alt-F11 shortcut for toggle menu

The reason for those are restrictions of the browser.
Some keyboard shortcuts cannot be intercepted.
Some functionality is not avialable.
